# Daily Problem


TLS is a powerful,widely deployed protocol that allows users to access web data over confidential, integrity-protected channels. But TLS has a serious limitation: it doesn’t allow a user to prove to
third parties that a piece of data she has accessed authentically
came from a particular website. As a result, data use is often restricted to its point of origin, curtailing data portability by users, a right acknowledged by recent regulations such as GDPR [8].
Specifically, when a user accesses data online via TLS, she cannot
securely export it, without help (hence permission) from the
current data holder. Vast quantities of private data are thus intentionally or unintentionally locked up in the “deep web”—the part of the web that isn’t publicly accessible.
To understand the problem, suppose Alice wants to prove to
Bob that she’s over 18. Currently, age verification services [1] require users to upload IDs and detailed personal information, which raises privacy concerns. But various websites, such as company payroll records or DMV websites, in principle store and serve verified birth dates. Alice could send a screenshot of her birth date fromsuch a site, but this is easily forged.And even if the screenshot could somehow be proven authentic, it would leak information— revealing her exact birth date, not just that she’s over 18. 
Proposed to prove provenance of online data to smart contracts,
oracles are a step towards exporting TLS-protected data to other
systemswith provenance and integrity assurances. Existing schemes, however, have serious limitations. They either only workwith deprecated TLS versions and offer no privacy from the oracle (e.g., TLSNotary [7]) or rely on trusted hardware (e.g., Town Crier [78]), against which various attacks have recently emerged, e.g., [24].
Another class of oracle schemes assumes server-side cooperation,
mandating that servers install TLS extensions (e.g., [65]) or
change application-layer logic (e.g., [31, 77]). Server-facilitated oracle schemes suffer from two fundamental problems. First, they
break legacy compatibility, causing a significant barrier to wide
adoption. Moreover, such solutions only provide conditional exportability because the web servers have the sole discretion to determine which data can be exported, and can censor export attempts at will. A mechanism that allows users to export any data
they have access to would enable a whole host of currently unrealizable applications.
