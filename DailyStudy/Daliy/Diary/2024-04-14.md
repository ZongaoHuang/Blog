## Introduction
**1. Overview**

In the evolving landscape of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, the integration of AI Agents with cybersecurity playbooks presents a pioneering approach to automate and enhance security operations. This integration aims to leverage the advanced capabilities of AI to interpret, react to, and mitigate security threats with unprecedented speed and precision. By harnessing the synergy between AI-driven agents and well-defined cybersecurity playbooks, organizations can potentially transform their security posture, ensuring robust and dynamic responses to a variety of cyber threats.

**2. AI Agent**

The concept of AI Agents has gained significant traction as technology has advanced to allow more complex, human-like interactions within digital environments. Originating from projects such as AutoGPT and academic exercises like the Stanford Town experiments, AI Agents have evolved from basic conversational models to sophisticated entities capable of complex task execution. These agents operate by breaking down tasks through natural language self-dialogue, planning, and executing actions using a variety of tools. With advancements like the introduction of the Function Call mode and Custom Instructions, AI Agents have moved from mere thought leaders to proactive implementers, integrating external tools and plugins to enhance their functionality and reach.

**3. Playbook**

Cybersecurity playbooks are essential frameworks that guide organizations through the steps necessary for effective threat detection, management, and response. These playbooks are designed to offer a standardized methodology for handling security incidents, ensuring consistency across various scenarios. As cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated, the importance of having detailed and adaptive playbooks grows. These frameworks not only provide a clear procedure during security incidents but also integrate with other aspects of IT operations, such as system hardening and vulnerability management, to create a comprehensive defense strategy.

**4. Challenges and Questions**

While the benefits of integrating AI Agents with cybersecurity playbooks are clear, several challenges must be addressed to fully realize their potential. First, the standardization and template creation of playbook content for AI training poses a significant challenge. It requires a structured yet flexible approach to encode security protocols in a manner that AI can interpret and implement. Second, the capability of AI Agents to autonomously identify threat patterns and execute corresponding playbook actions raises questions about the efficacy and reliability of automated responses without human oversight. These challenges highlight the need for further research and development in this area to ensure that AI integration not only meets the current standards of security operations but also advances them.
Against this backdrop, we aim to validate our hypothesis by exploring the following research questions:
RQ1: How to template and normalize existing Playbook content for AI Agent training?
RQ2: How to automate the process of recognizing threat patterns and executing the appropriate Playbook security response steps through an AI Agent to quickly respond to security incidents without human intervention?

Through this introduction, the paper will explore these dimensions, focusing on the transformative potential of AI Agents in cybersecurity operations and the pivotal challenges that must be overcome.
